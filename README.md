# qs
My Quantified Self code

I collect up data via various apps (and have used different ones in
the past); and sometimes directly into spreadsheets.  I've done some
graphing of them in the past.  Now I'm going to try to bring the lot
together, with "qsmerge" and "qschart" programs.

I'll try them in Python first, for convenience.  As I get older, and
more data accumulates, machines will be getter larger and faster.  A
poor excuse, but I'll stick with it for now.
