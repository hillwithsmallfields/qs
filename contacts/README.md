Contacts
========

Having had my contacts information spread out over bbdb and gmail
contacts, I decided to have one central definitive copy, in a
non-proprietary format.

Entries are cross-linked using a short UID system, to show who is in
the same family (with the aim of being able to group people together
for sending Christmas cards).
